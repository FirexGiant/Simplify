# Simplify
A basic "library" to simplify c++ a little bit. Similar to boost. 


#### Just a few things... ####

1. I am still working on this project. I plan to add more functions as I think of them and to clean it up/organize it more.

2. I made this to go along with a text adventure engine, so that's why in it's current state it seems a little weird at times. 

3. This is my first "library" and my first time actually dealing with custom namespaces (if you can't already tell) so any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
